    "\n",
    "a) Propagate uncertainties for the following expressions using [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org) following the examples for [uncorrelated variables](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/www.physi.uni-heidelberg.de/Einrichtungen/FP/Datenanalyse/FP_Gaussian_error_propagation.ipynb?flush_cache=false) and [correlated variables](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/www.physi.uni-heidelberg.de/Einrichtungen/FP/Datenanalyse/FP_Gaussian_error_propagation_corr.ipynb?flush_cache=false) from the FP web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "i) Find expressions for the absolute uncertainty $\\sigma_z$ for $z = x + y$ and $z = x - y$ \n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Find expressions for the relative uncertainty $\\sigma_z / z$ for $z = x \\cdot y, \\; z = x / y$ and $z = x^n y^n$\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) The acceleration of gravity with a simple pendulum is given by the following formula:\n",
    "$$g = 4  \\pi^2 \\frac{L}{T^2}$$\n",
    "The relevant variables are the length $L$ of the pendulum and the period $T$ with the corresponding errors $\\sigma_L$ and $\\sigma_T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) The radius $r$ and the height $h$ of a cylinder have been measured to $r = 2$ cm and $h = 3$ cm. The uncertainty for both measurements is $\\sigma = 0.05$ cm. Determine the volume of the cylinder and its uncertainty assuming (i) that both measurements are uncorrelated and (ii) that both measurements are fully correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The scattering angle and the radial distance of a certain particle can be determined from a position measurement $(x,y)$ \n",
    "$$r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \\quad \\theta = \\mathrm{atan2}(y, x)$$\n",
    "You find more on the [atan2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2) function on wikipedia. The position ($x$,$y$) is measured with the corresponding uncertainties $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$. Write a python function that returns the covariance matrix $U$ of $r$ and $\\theta$ for a given covariance matrix $V$ of $x$ and $y$. Determine $U$ under the assumption that $x$ and $y$ are uncorrelated. Hint: use the formula on page 17 of the slides of chapter 3.\n"
